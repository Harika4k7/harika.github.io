			If the transformed signal  is same as x(t), then the signal is periodic.  where T is fundamental period (the smallest period) of signal x(t) In discrete-time, the periodic signal is; 
                        Orthogonal Signal,Each component signal has no relationship with others. Orthogonal signal is denoted as φ(t).  Even and Odd Signal,One of characteristics of signal is symmetry that may be useful for signal analysis. Even signals are symmetric around vertical axis, and Odd signals are symmetric about origin.

			A  priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.

			There are two types of priority queues –Ascending priority queue :
                In this items can be inserted arbitrarily , but only smallest element can be removed,Descending priority queue :
                In this items can be inserted arbitrarily , but only largest element can be removed

			 Implied Mode,Address of the operands are specified implicitly in the definition of the instruction- No need to specify address in the instruction- EA = AC, or EA = Stack[SP], EA: Effective Address.                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                         Immediate Mode Instead of specifying the address of the operand,operand itself is specified- No need to specify address in the instruction- However, operand itself needs to be specified- Sometimes, require more bits than the address- Fast to acquire an operant 
                         Register Mode :Address specified in the instruction is the register address- Designated operand need to be in a register- Shorter address than the memory address- Saving address field in the instruction- Faster to acquire an operand than the memory

				 Direct Address Mode,Instruction specifies the memory address which,can be used directly to the physical memory- Faster than the other memory addressing modes- Too many bits are needed to specify the address 
                            for a large physical memory space- EA = IR(address), (IR(address): address field Indirect Addressing Mode
	                    The address field of an instruction specifies the address of a memory 	location that contains the address of the operand
                          - When the abbreviated address is used, large physical memory can 	  be addressed with a relatively small number of bits
           		  - Slow to acquire an operand because of an additional memory 	  	   access
                          - EA = M[IR(address)]

				The screen is marginally smaller than the Note 4, despite the cranked-up pixel count. Like the Note 4, text pops a little more, and pictures you take with the 16MP camera are obviously better replicated on the Note Edge’s screen.

				All told, it’s an excellent camera. The image stabilizing works well on all the neon lights that pepper Tokyo, while even people were neatly captured. There’s some noise, but it compares favorably against older Galaxy phones. 
				Daylight meant effortless captures and some really nice shots, if I say so myself.

			- The interrupt is usually initiated by an internal or an external signal rather than from the execution of an instruction (except for the software interrupt)- The address of the interrupt service program is determined by the hardware rather than from the address field of an instruction- An interrupt procedure usually stores all the 
                          information necessary to define the state of CPU 
                          rather than storing only the PC.

                           The state of the CPU is determined from;Content of the PC;  Content of all processor registers;Content of status bits
                           Many ways of saving the CPU state depending on the CPU architectures
